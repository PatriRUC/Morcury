# Morcury
A Go player matching system that assigns the most appropriate opposent for each player based the playing style that they provide. 

It was originally used to match Go players in Go games of Renmin University of China. These games were held with the help of MoChen Chess and Card Club, where I were the vice president. I developed this system to help match two players, like Cupid shot an arrow so two persons' hearts tied together and they fall in love. But Cupid is not a good name so I used another little god's name Mercury combining with MoChen to create Morcury.
